# Angular + ThreeJS

This project aims to integrate the ThreeJS library into Angular in a modular way. Every key piece of the ThreeJS library is augmented by Angular directive.
By doing so, complex scenes can be broken down into smaller and more manageable pieces.

### Current version
This project is still in Alpha version. Quite early in the process of oriduction. Most important pieces were established, however major changes still might happen before final release.

### Next steps
   1) Separate all 4 key components into its own NPM packages
   2) Create webComponents using these new NPM packages
